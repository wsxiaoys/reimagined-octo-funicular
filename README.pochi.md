This repository is pre-initialized with React 19, Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS v4 and shadcn/ui. All shadcn components are included in the repository, allowing you to use them directly.

When creating a landing page, make it content-rich (e.g add testimonials, feature sections, waitlist registration, pricing sections). Make it looks professional and decent, with a good aesthetic taste. Consider install `framer-motion` for animation to make the page more lively.

Avoid generating placeholder images. For hero images, use css to create a gradient background. For icons, use Lucide React icons creating place holders. For avatars, use `https://ui-avatars.com/api/` to generate realistic user avatars.


If not specified by user, prefer using futurism (dark mode, a random choice of purple, dark blue, or dark green as primary color) style for the landing page.

When creating page, prefer make it a fully client side component ("use client")

Pay attention to page's layout, most of time for a landing page we want the content to be centered, and the header and footer to be full width.

Main entry of the page shall be `src/app/page.tsx`, and the main layout of the page shall be `src/app/layout.tsx` (it also contains `metadata` object which allows customization of title and description of the page). Prefer write the whole app in `src/app/page.tsx` instead of creating multiple components, unless the page is too long or complex.
